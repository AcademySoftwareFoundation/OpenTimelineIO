# For Creatives

OpenTimelineIO can help solve a variety of conform, project interchange, studio pipelines, archival and other workflows.

The best place to start is our [Workflow tutorials and Example files](/user_tutorials/sample_media.md) which contain media as well as .otio files. 

[OpenTimelineIO support is available with the following integrations](integrations.md) allowing you to export otio files and import them (with some caveats).

If you don’t see your preferred software listed in the integrations, check for [available adaptors](/python/adapters.md) and use the project conversion tool `otioconvert`. This allows for workflows via project conversion. S

You can also download Raven - a free cross platform timeline visualizer.
