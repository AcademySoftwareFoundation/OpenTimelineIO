# For Creatives

OpenTimelineIO can help solve a variety of conform and project interchange and archive workflow challenges and be integrated into pipelines and asset management tools. 

The best place to start is our [Workflow tutorials and Example files](/user_tutorials/sample_media.md) which contain media as well as .otio files. 

[OpenTimelineIO support is available with the following integrations](integrations.md) allowing you to export otio files and import them (with some caveats).

If you donâ€™t see your preferred software listed in the integrations, check for [available adaptors](/python/adapters.md) and use the project conversion tool `otioconvert`. This allows for workflows via project conversion. S

You can also download Raven - a free cross platform timeline visualizer.
