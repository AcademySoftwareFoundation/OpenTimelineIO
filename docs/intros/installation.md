# Installation

There are various ways of working with OpenTimelineIO, from simply importing and exporting otio files in supported software, using the OpenTimelineIO Python API to automate workflows and writing custom project adapators, to native application integration and working with the core C++ library or language bindings. 


## Software Integrations

For most users, there is nothing to install to use OpenTimelineIO. OpenTimelineIO is available in many video software packages today, allowing for importing or exporting `.otio`, `.otiod` or `.otioz` files with no additional requirements.
