# Plugin Documentation

This documents all the plugins that ship with in the open
source OpenTimelineIO distribution.


This document is automatically generated by running the
`autogen_plugin_documentation` command, or by running `make plugin-model`.  It
is part of the unit tests suite and should be updated whenever the schema
changes.  If it needs to be updated, run: `make doc-plugins-update` and this

# Manifests

The manifests describe plugins that are visible to OpenTimelineIO.  The core and
contrib manifests are listed first, then any user-defined local plugins.

### cmx_3600

```
OpenTimelineIO CMX 3600 EDL Adapter
```

*source*: `opentimelineio/adapters/cmx_3600.py`


*Supported Features (with arguments)*:

- read_from_string: 
```
Reads a CMX Edit Decision List (EDL) from a string.
  Since EDLs don't contain metadata specifying the rate they are meant
  for, you may need to specify the rate parameter (default is 24).
  By default, read_from_string will throw an exception if it discovers
  invalid timecode in the EDL. For example, if a clip's record timecode
  overlaps with the previous cut. Since this is a common mistake in
  many EDLs, you can specify ignore_timecode_mismatch=True, which will
  supress these errors and attempt to guess at the correct record
  timecode based on the source timecode and adjacent cuts.
  For best results, you may wish to do something like this:

  Example:
      >>> try:
      ...     timeline = otio.adapters.read_from_string("mymovie.edl", rate=30)
      ... except EDLParseError:
      ...    print('Log a warning here')
      ...    try:
      ...        timeline = otio.adapters.read_from_string(
      ...            "mymovie.edl",
      ...            rate=30,
      ...            ignore_timecode_mismatch=True)
      ...    except EDLParseError:
      ...        print('Log an error here')

### otiod

```
OTIOD adapter - bundles otio files linked to local media in a directory

Takes as input an OTIO file that has media references which are all
ExternalReferences with target_urls to files with unique basenames that are
accessible through the file system and bundles those files and the otio file
into a single directory named with a suffix of .otiod.
```

into a single zip file with the suffix .otioz.  Can error out if files aren't
locally referenced or provide missing references

Can also extract the content.otio file from an otioz bundle for processing.

Note that OTIOZ files _always_ use the unix style path separator ('/'). This
ensures that regardless of which platform a bundle was created on, it can be
read on unix and windows platforms.

### hls_playlist

```
HLS Playlist OpenTimelineIO adapter

This adapter supports authoring of HLS playlists within OpenTimelineIO by using
clips to represent media fragments.

Status:
    - Export of Media Playlists well supported
    - Export of Master Playlists supported
    - Import of Media Playlists well supported
    - Import of Master Playlists unsupported
    - Explicit Variant Stream controls in Master Playlists unsupported

In general, you can author otio as follows:
    t = otio.schema.Timeline()
    track = otio.schema.Track("v1")
    track.metadata['HLS'] = {
        "EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS": None,
        "EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE": "VOD"
    }
    t.tracks.append(track)

    # Make a prototype media ref with the fragment's initialization metadata
    fragmented_media_ref = otio.schema.ExternalReference(
        target_url='video1.mp4',
        metadata={
            "streaming": {
                "init_byterange": {
                    "byte_count": 729,
                    "byte_offset": 0
                },
                "init_uri": "media-video-1.mp4"
            }
        }
    )

    # Make a copy of the media ref specifying the byte range for the fragment
    media_ref1 = fragmented_media_ref.deepcopy()
    media_ref1.available_range=otio.opentime.TimeRange(
        otio.opentime.RationalTime(0, 1),
        otio.opentime.RationalTime(2.002, 1)
    )
    media_ref1.metadata['streaming'].update(
        {
            "byte_count": 534220,
            "byte_offset": 1361
        }
    )

    # make the fragment and append it
    fragment1 = otio.schema.Clip(media_reference=media_ref1)
    track.append(fragment1)

    # (repeat to define each fragment)

The code above would yield an HLS playlist like:
    #EXTM3U
    #EXT-X-VERSION:7
    #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:2
    #EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
    #EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS
    #EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
    #EXT-X-MAP:BYTERANGE="729@0",URI="media-video-1.mp4"
    #EXTINF:2.00200,
    #EXT-X-BYTERANGE:534220@1361
    video1.mp4
    #EXT-X-ENDLIST

If you add min_segment_duration and max_segment_duration to the timeline's
metadata dictionary as RationalTime objects, you can control the rule set
deciding how many fragments to accumulate into a single segment. When nothing
is specified for these metadata keys, the adapter will create one segment per
fragment.

In general, any metadata added to the track metadata dict under the HLS
namespace will be included at the top level of the exported playlist (see
``EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS`` and ``EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE`` in the example
above). Each segment will pass through any metadata in the HLS namespace from
the media_reference.

If you write a Timeline with more than one track specified, then the adapter
will create an HLS master playlist.

The following track metadata keys will be used to inform exported master
playlist metadata per variant stream:
    bandwidth
    codec
    language
    mimeType
    group_id (audio)
    autoselect (audio)
    default (audio)
These values are translated to EXT-X-STREAM-INF and EXT-X-MEDIA
attributes as defined in sections 4.3.4.2 and 4.3.4.1 of
draft-pantos-http-live-streaming, respectively.

references into valid references where appropriate.

[Tutorial on how to write a Media Linker](write-a-media-linker).



## SchemaDefs

SchemaDef plugins define new external schema.

[Tutorial on how to write a schemadef](write-a-schemadef).


### xges

```
OpenTimelineIO GStreamer Editing Services XML Adapter.
```

*source*: `opentimelineio_contrib/adapters/xges.py`


*Serializable Classes*:

- GESMarker: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema that is a timestamp with metadata,
  essentially mimicking the GstMarker of the GES C libarary.
```
- GESMarkerList: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema that is a list of GESMarkers,
  ordered by
  their positions, essentially mimicking the GstMarkerList of the GES
  C libarary.
```
- GstCaps: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema that acts as an ordered collection of
  GstStructures, essentially mimicking the GstCaps of the Gstreamer C
  libarary. Each GstStructure is linked to a GstCapsFeatures, which is
  a list of features.

  In particular, this schema mimics the gst_caps_to_string and
  gst_caps_from_string C methods.
```
- GstCapsFeatures: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema that contains a collection of
  features,
  mimicking a GstCapsFeatures of the Gstreamer C libarary.
```
- GstStructure: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema that acts as a named dictionary with
  typed entries, essentially mimicking the GstStructure of the
  GStreamer C library.

  In particular, this schema mimics the gst_structure_to_string and
  gst_structure_from_string C methods. As such, it can be used to
  read and write the properties and metadatas attributes found in
  xges elements.

  Note that the types are to correspond to GStreamer/GES GTypes,
  rather than python types.

  Current supported GTypes:
  GType         Associated    Accepted
                Python type   aliases
  ======================================
  gint          int           int, i
  glong         int
  gint64        int
  guint         int           uint, u
  gulong        int
  guint64       int
  gfloat        float         float, f
  gdouble       float         double, d
  gboolean      bool          boolean,
                              bool, b
  string        str or None   str, s
  GstFraction   str or        fraction
                Fraction
  GstStructure  GstStructure  structure
                schema
  GstCaps       GstCaps
                schema
  GESMarkerList GESMarkerList
                schema

  Note that other types can be given: these must be given as strings
  and the user will be responsible for making sure they are already in
  a serialized form.
```
- XgesTrack: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema for storing a GESTrack.

  Not to be confused with OpenTimelineIO's schema.Track.
```
