# Plugin Documentation

This documents all the plugins that ship with in the open
source OpenTimelineIO distribution.


This document is automatically generated by running the
`autogen_plugin_documentation` command, or by running `make plugin-model`.  It
is part of the unit tests suite and should be updated whenever the schema
changes.  If it needs to be updated, run: `make doc-plugins-update` and this
file should be regenerated.

# Manifests

The manifests describe plugins that are visible to OpenTimelineIO.  The core and
contrib manifests are listed first, then any user-defined local plugins.

- `opentimelineio/adapters/builtin_adapters.plugin_manifest.json`
- `opentimelineio_contrib/adapters/contrib_adapters.plugin_manifest.json`

# Core Plugins

Manifest path: `opentimelineio/adapters/builtin_adapters.plugin_manifest.json`



## Adapter Plugins

Adapter plugins convert to and from OpenTimelineIO.

### otio_json

```

```

*source*: `opentimelineio/adapters/otio_json.py`


*Supported Features (with arguments)*:

- read_from_file: 
```
De-serializes an OpenTimelineIO object from a file

  Args:
      filepath (str): The path to an otio file to read from

  Returns:
      OpenTimeline: An OpenTimeline object
```
  - filepath
- read_from_string: 
```
De-serializes an OpenTimelineIO object from a json string

  Args:
      input_str (str): A string containing json serialized otio contents

  Returns:
      OpenTimeline: An OpenTimeline object
```
  - input_str
- write_to_file: 
```

  Args:

      input_otio (OpenTimeline): An OpenTimeline object
      filepath (str): The name of an otio file to write to
      indent (int): number of spaces for each json indentation level.
  Use -1 for no indentation or newlines.

  If target_schema_versions is None and the environment variable
  "OTIO_DEFAULT_TARGET_VERSION_FAMILY_LABEL" is set, will read a map out of
  that for downgrade target.  The variable should be of the form
  FAMILY:LABEL, for example "MYSTUDIO:JUNE2022".

  Returns:
      bool: Write success

  Raises:
      ValueError: on write error
      otio.exceptions.InvalidEnvironmentVariableError: if there is a problem
      with the default environment variable
      "OTIO_DEFAULT_TARGET_VERSION_FAMILY_LABEL".
```
  - input_otio
  - filepath
  - target_schema_versions
  - indent
- write_to_string: 
```
Serializes an OpenTimelineIO object into a string

  Args:
      input_otio (OpenTimeline): An OpenTimeline object
      indent (int): number of spaces for each json indentation level. Use
  -1 for no indentation or newlines.

  If target_schema_versions is None and the environment variable
  "OTIO_DEFAULT_TARGET_VERSION_FAMILY_LABEL" is set, will read a map out of
  that for downgrade target.  The variable should be of the form
  FAMILY:LABEL, for example "MYSTUDIO:JUNE2022".

  Returns:
      str: A json serialized string representation

  Raises:
      otio.exceptions.InvalidEnvironmentVariableError: if there is a problem
      with the default environment variable
      "OTIO_DEFAULT_TARGET_VERSION_FAMILY_LABEL".
```
  - input_otio
  - target_schema_versions
  - indent





### otiod

```
OTIOD adapter - bundles otio files linked to local media in a directory

Takes as input an OTIO file that has media references which are all
ExternalReferences with target_urls to files with unique basenames that are
accessible through the file system and bundles those files and the otio file
into a single directory named with a suffix of .otiod.
```

*source*: `opentimelineio/adapters/otiod.py`


*Supported Features (with arguments)*:

- read_from_file:
  - filepath
  - absolute_media_reference_paths
- write_to_file:
  - input_otio
  - filepath
  - media_policy
  - dryrun





### otioz

```
OTIOZ adapter - bundles otio files linked to local media

Takes as input an OTIO file that has media references which are all
ExternalReferences with target_urls to files with unique basenames that are
accessible through the file system and bundles those files and the otio file
into a single zip file with the suffix .otioz.  Can error out if files aren't
locally referenced or provide missing references

Can also extract the content.otio file from an otioz bundle for processing.

Note that OTIOZ files _always_ use the unix style path separator ('/'). This
ensures that regardless of which platform a bundle was created on, it can be
read on unix and windows platforms.
```

*source*: `opentimelineio/adapters/otioz.py`


*Supported Features (with arguments)*:

- read_from_file:
  - filepath
  - extract_to_directory
- write_to_file:
  - input_otio
  - filepath
  - media_policy
  - dryrun





## Media Linkers

Media Linkers run after the adapter has read in the file and convert the media
references into valid references where appropriate.

[Tutorial on how to write a Media Linker](write-a-media-linker).



## SchemaDefs

SchemaDef plugins define new external schema.

[Tutorial on how to write a schemadef](write-a-schemadef).



## HookScripts

HookScripts are extra plugins that run on _hooks_.

[Tutorial on how to write a hookscript](write-a-hookscript).



## Hooks

Hooks are the points at which hookscripts will run.





# Contrib Plugins

Plugins in Contrib are supported by the community and provided as-is.

Manifest path: `opentimelineio_contrib/adapters/contrib_adapters.plugin_manifest.json`



## Adapter Plugins

Adapter plugins convert to and from OpenTimelineIO.

```
  - input_str

  Args:
      input_otio (OpenTimeline): An OpenTimeline object

```
  - input_otio





## Media Linkers

Media Linkers run after the adapter has read in the file and convert the media
references into valid references where appropriate.

[Tutorial on how to write a Media Linker](write-a-media-linker).



## SchemaDefs

SchemaDef plugins define new external schema.

[Tutorial on how to write a schemadef](write-a-schemadef).


### xges

```
OpenTimelineIO GStreamer Editing Services XML Adapter.
```

*source*: `opentimelineio_contrib/adapters/xges.py`


*Serializable Classes*:

- GESMarker: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema that is a timestamp with metadata,
  essentially mimicking the GstMarker of the GES C libarary.
```
- GESMarkerList: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema that is a list of GESMarkers,
  ordered by
  their positions, essentially mimicking the GstMarkerList of the GES
  C libarary.
```
- GstCaps: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema that acts as an ordered collection of
  GstStructures, essentially mimicking the GstCaps of the Gstreamer C
  libarary. Each GstStructure is linked to a GstCapsFeatures, which is
  a list of features.

  In particular, this schema mimics the gst_caps_to_string and
  gst_caps_from_string C methods.
```
- GstCapsFeatures: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema that contains a collection of
  features,
  mimicking a GstCapsFeatures of the Gstreamer C libarary.
```
- GstStructure: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema that acts as a named dictionary with
  typed entries, essentially mimicking the GstStructure of the
  GStreamer C library.

  In particular, this schema mimics the gst_structure_to_string and
  gst_structure_from_string C methods. As such, it can be used to
  read and write the properties and metadatas attributes found in
  xges elements.

  Note that the types are to correspond to GStreamer/GES GTypes,
  rather than python types.

  Current supported GTypes:
  GType         Associated    Accepted
                Python type   aliases
  ======================================
  gint          int           int, i
  glong         int
  gint64        int
  guint         int           uint, u
  gulong        int
  guint64       int
  gfloat        float         float, f
  gdouble       float         double, d
  gboolean      bool          boolean,
                              bool, b
  string        str or None   str, s
  GstFraction   str or        fraction
                Fraction
  GstStructure  GstStructure  structure
                schema
  GstCaps       GstCaps
                schema
  GESMarkerList GESMarkerList
                schema

  Note that other types can be given: these must be given as strings
  and the user will be responsible for making sure they are already in
  a serialized form.
```
- XgesTrack: 
```
An OpenTimelineIO Schema for storing a GESTrack.

  Not to be confused with OpenTimelineIO's schema.Track.
```
