LONG_DESCRIPTION = """OpenTimelineIO is an interchange format and API for
editorial cut information. OTIO is not a container format for media, rather it
contains information about the order and length of cuts and references to
external media.

OTIO includes both a file format and an API for manipulating that format. It
also includes a plugin architecture for writing adapters to convert from/to
existing editorial timeline formats. It also implements a dependency- less
library for dealing strictly with time, opentime.

You can provide adapters for your video editing tool or pipeline as needed.
Each adapter allows for import/export between that proprietary tool and the
OpenTimelineIO format."""
