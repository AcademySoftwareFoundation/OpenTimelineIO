<p>OpenTimelineIO (OTIO) is an API and interchange format for editorial cut information.
    You can think of it as a modern Edit Decision List (EDL) that also includes an API for
    reading, writing, and manipulating editorial data.</p>

<p>OTIO supports clips, timing, tracks, transitions, markers, metadata, etc. but not embedded
    video or audio. Video and audio media are referenced externally. We encourage 3rd party
    vendors, animation studios and visual effects studios to work together as a community to
    provide adaptors for each video editing tool and pipeline.</p>

<p>This is the public API documentation for java-opentimelineio.</p>
